    <p>Once Purpleten and Zuphixy were proven to be healthy Zuphixy went to live with Purpleten and her parents. For the first few wheels bodyguards protected Purpleten and Zuphixy but as the years past the wheelchair people forgot about the Oidohombres and stopped guarding Zuphixy and Purpleten.</p>

    <p>Then one day Zuphixy was in a field pretending to be a detective like Purpleten’s uncle when suddenly he smelled smoke and looked around and saw some Oidohombres run away from a fire in the next field.</p>

    <p>Zuphixy, who had received a camera as a gift from Purpleten’s uncle, took a picture of what happened. Purpleten’s uncle determined that the Oidohombres had purposely started the fire so that the wheel people would not have food to eat. Thanks to Zuphixy, who also informed the firemen in time, the fire did not do too much damage.</p>

    <p>After he alerted the wheelchair people to the fire, Zuphixy decided to go to school to become a policeman and a detective. As the years went by, Zuphixy became well known in the land of Silla-Tierra as a detective.</p>

    <p>One day Zuphixy was walking along the riverbank when he saw a dam that looked to be man-made. He also noticed that the water was rising. If he did not break the dam soon, the river would overflow its banks and flood the town. Zuphixy worked fast and managed to open the dam just as the water was about to flood over.</p>

    <p>Before the dam broke, he also exposed some footprints that matched the boots of the Oidohombres. After a few tests he found that they matched the same ear man, Mr. Oidohombre who had first caught him and Purpleten so many years ago.</p>

    <p>When the wheelchair people heard how he had saved the town again they were so happy they had a parade to show how thankful they were.</p>

    <p>The next day Purpleten and Zuphixy got married and a year to the day of the parade Purpleten had a baby boy who they named Zoofixy. When Zoofixy was eight-wheels-old Zuphixy took him on an overnight trip to “Sustantivo Arena Castillo Ciuda” beach where he taught Zoofixy how to make big sand castles. The sand castles prevented Zuphixy from seeing Zoofixy and the Oidohombres kidnapped him. Zuphixy went home to plan how to get his son back.</p>

    <p>It was decided that Purpleten and Zuphixy would have to go to the Woods of Despair again to rescue their son. They had walked for a whole day when they came to the spot where they first met. As they were resting they heard the sound of a twig breaking. Purpleten looked in the direction of the sound and saw three Oidohombres trying to move something that took a lot of their effort.</p>

    <p>Purpleten got Zuphixy’s attention as he was studying the ear-shaped prints on the path and told him what she had just seen and gave him the heart-shaped flower which she had kept with her all these years just in case.</p>

    <p>Zuphixy whispered to Purpleten, “I will check it out.” He went to where he could have a good view of the Oidohombres but they could not see him.</p>

    <p>After a few minutes he found out that the men were dragging Zoofixy. Zuphixy was so angry at the men that he forgot to stay hidden and instead ran at them like a raging bull.</p>

    <p>As soon as the Oidohombres saw Zuphixy who had the heart-shaped flower poking out of his pocket they magically disappeared. Zuphixy took his son to Purpleten who was still sitting in the spot where they first met.</p>

    <p>When Zuphixy and Zoofixy were beside Purpleten, Zuphixy said, “Let’s all go home.”</p>

    <p>No sooner had he finished saying home, than he found himself back in his bedroom in his own world. When he saw himself in his mirror he noticed that he was a 16-year-old boy again instead of a man.</p>

    <p>As Zuphixy got his bearings, he started to think about what may have happened to Purpleten and Zoofixy.</p>
