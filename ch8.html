    <p>Back at home Zuphixy opened the door to his bedroom and wheeled himself out in the hall with Rugger at his side wagging his tail. Suddenly Zuphixy stopped and listened. He could hear a whole bunch of people crying.</p>

    <p>Zuphixy went into his living room and saw all his friends and family crying. “Why is everyone so sad?” he asked. One woman who did not recognize him said, “Don’t you know that Zuphixy has died?”</p>

    <p>With a shocked look on his face, Zuphixy replied, “No, he is not dead. I am Zuphixy.” When they heard Zuphixy’s voice, his parents ran into the living room from the kitchen and said, “Is that you Zuphixy?”</p>

    <p>Zuphixy said, “Yes it is me, mom, and …” but his friend interrupted him and said, “No, it is a ghost!”</p>

    <p>Zuphixy said, “No, I am not a ghost. I will prove it to you by sitting on your lap. If I am a ghost you will not feel any weight.”</p>

    <p>Zuphixy wheeled over to his friend and transferred onto his friend’s lap. Right away his friend said, “OK, OK, you’re not a ghost. Can you get off of me now?” Zuphixy transferred himself back onto his wheelchair and wheeled over to his parents.</p>

    <p>When Zuphixy and his parents had gone into Zuphixy’s bedroom where they could talk in private his mother asked him, “Where have you been for the last two weeks?”</p>

    <p>Zuphixy said, “It’s only been two weeks? I was magically transferred to another world ….”</p>

    <p>Zuphixy’s mother said, “There is no such thing as magic or for that matter another world, so I repeat where you have been?”</p>

    <p>Zuphixy said, “Then tell me how I got to a place where my wheelchair was talking to me in the woods that until then I had never seen before. I also had grown up and had a wife and child.”</p>

    <p>Zuphixy’s father said, “It does not matter right now where you were. We are just happy that you are back. Now let’s change the memorial service into a happy welcome home party!”</p>

    <p>Which is what they did and they lived happily ever after.</p>
