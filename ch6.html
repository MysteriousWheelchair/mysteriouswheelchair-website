    <p>Once home Zuphixy’s parents put on the TV to watch the news. For the first time since Zuphixy was missing they heard the news reporter say, “Today we just got information that a disabled boy about the age of 16 was kidnapped. He was last seen wearing light gray sweat pants with a red sweater …” Then the TV lost the signal.</p>

    <p>Zuphixy’s mom ran to the phone and phoned the police station and said they had heard the news about the kidnapping. The police told her that that boy had black hair instead of golden color hair like Zuphixy.</p>

    <p>The next day Zuphixy’s mom went to town to go shopping. While in the mall she saw a crowd of teenagers. One of them had yellow hair and was sitting in a scooter that you can rent for use in the mall. She went up to him and called out, “Zuphixy, Zuphixy, is that you Zuphixy?” When she saw the funny looks on the faces of the teenagers she realized that it was not Zuphixy. One of the teenagers who were sitting around said, “Sorry lady, but you got the wrong boy. This here is Zipup and he cannot talk.”</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Zuphixy’s father had finished work and had gone to the flower shop to get some flowers for a memorial service for Zuphixy. While in the shop he saw a wheelchair with what looked like a 16-year-old boy with yellow hair speed past the store. Zuphixy’s father thought that it could be Zuphixy. He dropped the flowers and ran out of the store. When he caught up to the wheelchair he found out that it was just some other teenagers using an old wheelchair as a go-cart.</p>

    <p>Sadly Zuphixy’s father went back to the flower shop and purchased the flowers. On the way home Zuphixy’s Father thought he saw another wheelchair on the side of the road. As he came closer it turned out it was only a biker pulling a baby buggy.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Zuphixy’s mom had come home and spent the whole afternoon on the phone making arrangements for the memorial service. At the end of the day it was agreed that the memorial service would be in two days at the “Peace Church”.</p>

    <p>The next day Zuphixy’s mom got right to work baking and cooking for all the people who would be attending the memorial service. She insisted on doing this to help keep her mind off the idea that Zuphixy was dead.</p>
